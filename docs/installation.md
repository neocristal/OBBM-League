# Installation
botbowl is a pip-installable python package. We recommend installing with [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) but it is not a requirement. 

## Python version
botbowl currently works with python 3.6 - 3.10 
Verify your python version with 
```
python --version
```
If you just installed Anaconda, create and activate a new environment. 
```
conda create --name botbowl python=3.8
conda activate botbowl
```

## Installation with pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/njustesen/botbowl
```
Or, use ```pip3``` if your pip points to a python 2 installation.

## Installation with git

Alternatively, if you want to run our examples or develop on botbowl, you can clone the repository and install it locally.
```
git clone https://github.com/njustesen/botbowl
cd botbowl
python setup.py build
pip install -e .
```
To test the installation, run the following:
```
python -c "import botbowl"
```
This should not produce an import error.

If you cloned the repository and installed locally, you can start the web server:
```
python examples/server_example.py 
```
and then go the [http://127.0.0.1:1234/](http://127.0.0.1:1234/) to play a game.

## Compiling with Cython
"[Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) is a language that makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself."

Some of the botbowl modules are prepared for compilation with Cython. Compiling them will make the framework run faster. 

Installation through pip will automatically build with Cython if possible. You can test if botbowl was compiled successfully by running `import botbowl.core.pathfinding.cython_pathfinding` in a python prompt. If it doesn't raise an error, you're good to go.  

If you cloned the repository with git, you need to manually call the build script by standing in the root of the repo and running:
```
python setup.py build 
```
If you get the following message ```You've built botbowl without cython compilation, error message=<error message here>```, 
something went wrong (you can still use botbowl, just not with the speedup). Possible error messages and solutions: 

* **"No compiler found"** - the distutils module did not find a compiler. See the section below about how to install one.
* **"Cython could not be imported"** - python could not import the cython module, in should be installed when you run `pip install -e .`. If that's not working try manually installing it via pip, double check [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt) for the version botbowl uses.
* **"No compatible windows compiler"** - the installation script is built to use the MS Visual Studio C++ compiler. Other compiler (e.g. Clang) could raise this error. Try installing Visual Studio with the instructions below.

### Installing a compiler 
**Windows**
